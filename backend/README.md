Steps to run backend code locally:

1. Ensure that python is installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
2. Install Django and its API libraries using 'pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers)
3. Path to /backend directory and running the following command 'python manage.py runserver'
4. Go to localhost:8000 in your browser to ensure backend is running

Here are some commands to get you up and running:
- http://localhost:8000/admin : This allows a developer to see their local db.sqlite3 
- http://localhost:8000/api/VIEW_OF_CHOICE : This allows a developer to manually send data to the database using established api
